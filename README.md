# Handwriting Generator Project 

## Overview 
This project was implemented as part of a semester-goals activity in ECE49401 at Purdue University in West Lafayette (Spring 2025). 
The goal of the project was to create a model that could be trained on a small sample of an indvidiual's handwriting and then generate text in that handwriting style.
The project was implemented in Python using pytorch and the handwriting generation was accomplished using a VAE model. 

## Usage 
This repository represents only an early prototype of a true handwriting generation model and is not intended for use.
